In this HTML/CSS project the task is to, in a simpllified manner, replicate the Google homepage. With simplified, meaning to skip e.g. the functionality of the search bar. 
With this project, I will get an idea on how to structure a web page on my own. It will be good practice to find answers on my own and solve problems. Also, I will learn to do some basic styling with CSS
